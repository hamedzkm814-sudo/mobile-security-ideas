## 1. Sentinel Message (Conditional Emergency Messaging)

### Concept
Sentinel Message is a mobile security feature that automatically sends an emergency message
as soon as the device regains any form of network signal (cellular or data).

### Key Features
- Automatically sends a pre-written emergency message
- Includes the last known GPS coordinates
- Activates only when the device detects a network signal
- Designed for low battery consumption
- Useful in kidnapping, disaster, or signal-loss scenarios

### Use Case
If a user is in a no-signal area and briefly regains signal,
the message is sent immediately without requiring manual interaction.

## 2. Message Alarm (Scheduled One-Time Emergency Message)

### Concept
Message Alarm allows a user to schedule an emergency message to be sent at a specific time.
If the user does not cancel it before the scheduled time, the message is automatically sent.

### Key Features
- Time-based automatic message delivery
- No user confirmation required at send time
- Can include GPS location and predefined contacts
- Useful in situations where the user anticipates risk

### Use Case
A user schedules a message before entering a potentially dangerous situation.
If they are unable to cancel it, the system assumes distress and sends the alert.

## 3. Guardian Network (Crowd-Sourced Emergency Response)

### Concept
Guardian Network is a decentralized, crowd-based safety system.
When activated, it sends an emergency alert to trusted users and nearby app users
within a predefined geographic radius.

### Key Features
- Hidden or quick-activation emergency trigger
- Sends real-time location data
- Can include photo or short audio evidence
- Alerts nearby users and optionally local authorities

### Use Case
In street emergencies, assaults, or medical crises,
nearby verified users can respond faster than centralized services.
